# I HAVE MADE A FLIGHT RESERVATION SYSTEM 
# ADMIN CAN ADD, OR EDIT THE FLIGHT DETAILS
# ALL THE THINGS ARE CASE SENSITVE SO BE SURE ABOUT THAT
# THE FLIGHT DETAILS ARE STORED IN THE FORM OF A map<string<map<vector>>> format . After addition the details are added into this vector which is always fetched by the user
# SEAT-MATRIX REFERS TO THE ARRANGMENT OF SEATS. THE USER WILL BE SHOWN SEATS AUTOMATICALLY ON THE BASIS OF SEAT MATRIX SINCE THE LOOP IS USING THE CHARACTERS OF SEAT MATRIX AS I,J
# YOU CAN ALSO ADD THE CODE FOR DELETION INSIDE IT
# THE USER IS ABLE TO SEE THE FLIGHTS FROM TODAY TO NEXT 10 DAYS, THIS IS POSSIBLE DUE TO CTIME
# IF THE FLIGHT DETAILS ARE ADDED OR EDITED, THE USER IS ABLE TO SEE IT
# A VIDEO OF PROJECT IS AVAILABLE AT MY LINKED-IN TOO.


#IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE YOU CAN WORK AT DELETION OF FLIGHT, NOT TO DISPLAY FLIGHTS OF THE PASSED TIME(OF THE CURRENT DAY ONLY) , SINCE I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE PAST DAYS HERE
